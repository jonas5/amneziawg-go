=== Dynamic peers authentication example ===

This example shows how to utilize netlink's multicast notifications
in AmneziaWG kernel module to provide dynamic peer authentication.

To compile it, you must install some pre-requisites:

```shell
apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev
```

After that, build example with the following command:

```shell
gcc notification-listener.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libnl-3.0 libnl-genl-3.0) -o notification-listener
```

Bring up AWG interface with `awg-quick` as usually, edit `accounts.csv` file accordingly to your needs and then run:

```shell
sudo ./notification-listener ./approve.sh ./accounts.csv
```
